"""
main.py

Entry point for the FastAPI app.

Includes routers for:
- Landing page (`/`)
- Health check (`/ping`)
- Very late shipment prediction (`/predict_very_late/`)
- Late shipment prediction (`/predict_late/`) â€” conditionally included for local use only

Note:
- The "late shipment" prediction endpoint (`/predict_late/`) is excluded on Render due to memory limitations.
  It is only registered if the `late_model.pkl` file exists, which allows local use without causing issues in deployment.
