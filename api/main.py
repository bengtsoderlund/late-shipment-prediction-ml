"""
main.py

Entry point for the FastAPI app.

Includes routers for:
- Landing page (`/`)
- Health check (`/ping`)
- Very late shipment prediction (`/predict_very_late/`)

Note:
- The "late shipment" prediction endpoint (`/predict_late/`) is currently disabled 
  due to memory constraints on Renderâ€™s free tier. It can be re-enabled by 
  upgrading to a paid plan with higher memory capacity.
